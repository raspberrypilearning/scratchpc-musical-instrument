This video shows a drumkit made from *actual* pots and pans, using some chopsticks wrapped in conductive tape and connected to a `GND` pin as a 'common ground' to activate each drum like a button when touched. 

Because of the excellent conductivity of the steel pots, you can touch them anywhere with the 'drumsticks' to make the right drum sound in Scratch!
