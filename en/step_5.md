## Upgrade your project

Got to the end of the project but still want to do more? 

How about:
+ Adding some on-screen actions when a note sounds, like making sprites move or change costume
+ Creating instructions to flash on the screen and help learn simple songs
+ Upgrading your instrument by making it with better materials
+ Making another instrument and starting a band!

This video shows a drumkit made from *actual* pots and pans, using some chopsticks wrapped in conductive tape and connected to a `GND` pin as a 'common ground' to activate each drum like a button when touched. 

Because of the excellent conductivity of the steel pots, you can touch them anywhere with the 'drumsticks' to make the right drum sound in Scratch!
