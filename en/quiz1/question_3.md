legend: Question 3 of 3
---

When speaking about **electronics**, what do we mean by components 'having a common ground'?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 1: When two countries use the same colour wiring.

--- feedback ---

No. Wiring colours can be different from country to country; it's just helpful to use certain colours for certain jobs, to make it easier to debug circuits. This isn't what we're talking about.

- (x) 2: Multiple components are connected to the same ground (`GND`) pin.

--- feedback ---

Excellent. One leg of a component should connect to a numbered pin and the other leg to a ground (`GND`) pin. You can connect lots of components to one GND pin to save space.

- ( ) 3: Multiple components are connected to the same numbered pin.

--- feedback ---

No. Think about which pin the components might share and try again. 

--- /feedback ---

- ( ) 4: None of the components are working.

--- feedback ---

No. While your common ground might be the *reason why* none of your components are working, this isn't what we mean. Have another go.
