## Introduction

In this project, you’ll learn how to connect several different inputs to your GPIO pins to create a drum kit, or other musical instrument of your choice.

You’ll connect several ‘buttons’ to your Pi to act as inputs that will trigger sounds, then design a physical instrument which you can use and play!
