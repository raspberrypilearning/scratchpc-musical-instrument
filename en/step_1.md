Make a drum kit, guitar, or other musical instrument of your choice!

A musical instrument can be anything that takes a user's input and turns it into sounds. Consider all of the musical instruments you know and think about how you might copy the way they work using simple inputs.

In this example, the buttons on the guitar's neck choose the note, and touching the 'pick' to the contact on the body changes the volume from 0 % to 100 % and back again when removed.
