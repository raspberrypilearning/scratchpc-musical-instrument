## Introduction

In this project, you’ll learn how to connect several different inputs to your GPIO pins to create a drum kit, or other musical instrument of your choice.

You’ll connect several ‘buttons’ to your Pi to act as inputs that will trigger sounds, then design a physical instrument which you can use and play!

### What you will make

A musical instrument can be anything that takes a user's input and turns it into sounds. You could make anything at all that does this! Consider all of the musical instruments you know and think about how you might copy the way they work using simple inputs.

Here are some other musical instruments to give you inspiration:

'Scratchivarius' Violin:

In this example the 'bow' is acting as the ground for the strings, which are made from conductive thread and are connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

Raspberry Pi Guitar Hero:

In this example the buttons on the guitar's neck choose the note, and touching the 'pick' to the contact on the body the volume is changed from 0% to 100% and back again when removed.
